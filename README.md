# Magix Extras
### IMPORTANT: These mods are to be used along with magix-fix.
They have been made to work along with the fixed version of Magix, which you can figure out how to install over [here](https://github.com/plasma4/magix-fix/blob/main/README.md). The original creator, pelletsstarPL, has abandoned Magix and these Magix mods for the time being.

## Installation instructions for local development/playing
You may install the local version of magix-fix [here](https://github.com/plasma4/magix-fix/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) (or, if you have already installed it, you can skip this step). Be sure to extract the .zip file to make sure things work properly!

You have two options:
- Install these mods through links
- Install these mods by locally copying them over

To get them installed through links, you can do it in a similar fashion. Click on Use Magix, add the link or links at the end, and copy all of the text **without deleting the original 2 Magix files**. You'll need to reload the page in order to actually install them; you can't just simply Load Mods.

However, to locally copy them over, you'll need to manually get the sprite sheet out and download the files from the links. Then, you can import it directly (without the starting part of the url, so, for example, the Thot mod would just become `thot.js` when imported).
